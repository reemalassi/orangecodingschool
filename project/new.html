<h1>Feeling Proud: A Guide to Your Emotions</h1>  
<P> The smile on your face is reaching from ear to ear. Your chest is puffed out. You feel confident and accomplished. And to top it all off, even your hair is perfectly coiffed today too! 
    What’s got you in such a good mood? Well, you’re feeling proud as fuck right now! You’re proud of who you are and what you’ve done, and you’re celebrating it. Way to go! Can we celebrate
     together for a second? Ok. Ready? Go! </P>

<h4>A Deeper Look at Feeling Proud</h4>

<p>Feeling proud is the best. What you’ve done is totally awesome and you know it.
     You’ve worked really hard to achieve it, and what you’ve done for 
     yourself — or others — deserves to be celebrated. 

    It might’ve been something as simple as taking a shower and making sure that you’ve had enough water to drink today. AMAZING! That can be some really hard shit to do when we’re feeling low, so we’re proud of you. You could’ve also discovered a new planet,
     flew a spaceship, landed on it, and are about to study it for the rest of your life. ALSO AMAZING! Accomplishments, both major and minor, 
    should be celebrated (and we’re here to do that with you!). </p>

    <p>Let’s break down the word “proud.” According to <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/proud">Dictionary</a> 
        “feeling pleasure and satisfaction because you or people connected 
        with you have done or got something good.” Take your pet, for example. You could be proud of
         them for not bunny-kicking you awake to feed them at 5am. But let’s focus on you right now! </p>

<h4>How Feeling Proud Shows Up Mentally</h4>
<p>Pride doesn’t always have to be related to being stubborn, self-indulgent,
     and egotistical like it’s usually made out to be. It can be about celebrating all that you’ve achieved!
